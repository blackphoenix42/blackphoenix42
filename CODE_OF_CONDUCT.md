# Code of Conduct

> This project adopts the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org) Code of Conduct (v2.1) with light project-specific clarifications.

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and maintainers, pledge to make participation in this project and community a harassment‑free experience for everyone, regardless of:

- Age, body size, visible or invisible disability
- Ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression
- Level of experience, education, socio-economic status
- Nationality, personal appearance, race, religion (or lack thereof)
- Sexual identity and orientation

We commit to acting in ways that foster an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Showing empathy and kindness toward others
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Using inclusive, gender-neutral language when possible
- Focusing on what is best for the community and project
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment or intimidation
- Publishing _others’_ private information (doxxing) without explicit permission
- Sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior

## Responsibilities of Maintainers

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject contributions (code, issues, comments, commits, wiki edits, pull requests) that do not align with this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors they judge to be harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces (repository, issues, pull requests, discussions, documentation, chat platforms) and when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces (e.g., conferences, meetups, podcasts, social media under the project’s name).

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the maintainers at:

- Email: <REPLACE_WITH_CONTACT_EMAIL>
- (Optional) Discord / Chat: <REPLACE_WITH_COMMUNITY_HANDLE>

Reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All complaints will be treated as confidential to the extent legally possible. The maintainers will determine and communicate the resolution that they deem appropriate.

If you are unsure whether something is a violation, err on the side of reporting; we would rather have one report too many than miss a chance to protect the community.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Maintainers will use these Community Impact Guidelines to determine the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1. Correction

   - Impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.
   - Consequence: A private, written warning with clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate.

2. Warning

   - Impact: A single incident or series of actions after a previous correction.
   - Consequence: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the impacted parties, including unsolicited interaction, for a specified period. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

3. Temporary Ban

   - Impact: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.
   - Consequence: A temporary ban from any interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct.

4. Permanent Ban
   - Impact: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, harassment, or aggression; or an egregious violation (e.g., threats, hate speech).
   - Consequence: A permanent ban from any interaction in community spaces.
